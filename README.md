### VBA Challenge Project

#### **Overview**
The purpose of this project was to refactor code  in VBA that would analyze different stocks and their information. Of the utmost importance is the annual return of each stock. Additionally, the volume(or amount of  stock being traded) was calculated over the year of interest. The code runs through a selection of 12 stocks that are of the client's interest for the years of 2017 and 2018.


#### **Results**
The [results](https://github.com/encollin94/stock-analysis/blob/main/VBAChallenge_2017_returns.png) for 2017 show a positive return on investments for all stocks, except for stock ticker number TERP. The [results](https://github.com/encollin94/stock-analysis/blob/main/VBAChallenge_2018_returns.png) show a majority of negative return on investments, except for ticker number RUN and ENPH. Further analysis should be done one what undustry these stocks are in and how that industry is affected by economic fluctuations.
